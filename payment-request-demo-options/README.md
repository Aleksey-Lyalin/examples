# Payment Request API demo with options

A small extension to the [very simple demo](https://github.com/SamsungInternet/examples/tree/master/payment-request-demo-simple) from the 
["How to take payments on the web with the Payment Request API"](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/how-to-take-payments-on-the-web-with-the-payment-request-api-a523f6fc7c1f)
blog post. This version includes contact name, telephone, email address and shipping address. 

Otherwise it's the same as the simple version (instructions below).

***

You can just enter made-up details - it just simulates the server-side so won't actually take a real payment!

**[Try it out here](https://samsunginter.net/examples/payment-request-demo-extended/)**

## Development

To run locally, spin up any static web server, such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
or [Chrome's web server extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en).

Then load it up in a browser with support for the Payment Request API - try Samsung Internet v5,
Chrome for Android, or [preview builds of Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/12/15/payment-request-api-edge/).

If you're not familiar with pointing your mobile phone to a local server on your development machine,
there are some instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/local-server) 
and Samsung Internet specific info [here, under 'How do I debug'](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/introducing-samsung-internet-for-developers-6c3a3be42f72).
